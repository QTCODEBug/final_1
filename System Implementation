System Implementation

Hardware Architecture
Description of the functions of the peripherals on the FRDM-KL46Z board used to implement the system:

| Component         | Function                                                   |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| MAG3110 Sensor    | Reads magnetic field data to determine the direction.      |
| SW1 Push Button   | Toggles between the system's active and inactive states.   |
| SW2 Push Button   | Resets the system state.                                   |
| Green LED         | Blinks at 1Hz when the system is active.                   |
| Red LED           | Blinks at 2Hz when the system is inactive.                 |
| LCD Screen        | Displays the compass direction.                            |
| Timer             | Determines the blink intervals of the LEDs.                |
 Implementation Steps:

1. Configure MAG3110 Sensor:
   - Set up I2C communication with the MAG3110 sensor.
   - Read magnetic field data and calculate the direction.

2. Configure LEDs and Push Buttons:
   - Set initial states for the green and red LEDs.
   - Configure interrupts for SW1 and SW2 push buttons.

3. Display on LCD Screen:
   - Set up communication with the LCD screen.
   - Update the display with the direction based on sensor data.

4. Toggle Active and Inactive States:
   - Use interrupts to switch between states when SW1 is pressed.
   - Reset the system when SW2 is pressed.

5. Use Timer:
   - Set up a timer to control the blink frequencies of the green and red LEDs.
