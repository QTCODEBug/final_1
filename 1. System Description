 1. System Description

 Inputs:
- MAG3110 Magnetometer Sensor: Used to detect direction.
- SW1 Push Button: Toggles between the system's active and inactive states.
  - When the system is inactive, press SW1 to switch to the active state.
  - When the system is active, press SW1 to switch to the inactive state.
- SW2 Push Button: Resets the system to its normal state.

Outputs:
- Green LED:
  - Blinks at 1Hz when the system is active.
  - Turns off when the system is inactive.
- Red LED:
  - Blinks at 2Hz when the system is inactive.
  - Turns off when the system is active.
- LCD Screen: Displays the compass direction.
 Counter:
- Uses a timer to determine the blink intervals of the LEDs.

2. Technical Specification

- The MAG3110 magnetometer sensor will be configured to read magnetic field data and calculate the direction.
- The system will have the capability to switch between active and inactive states via the SW1 push button.
- When switching states, the system will either continue or stop monitoring the sensor status and display the results on the LCD screen.
- The SW2 push button will reset the system to its initial state.
- The green and red LEDs will reflect the system's operational status based on the set blink frequencies.
